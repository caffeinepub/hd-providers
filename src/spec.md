# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a grocery and food delivery app with product browsing, shopping cart, checkout, and admin panel for managing products.

**Planned changes:**
- Create home page with four clickable categories: Vegetables, Dairy, Groceries, and Food
- Build product listing page showing products with images, names, prices, and category filtering
- Implement add to cart functionality with quantity increment
- Create cart page with quantity adjustment, item removal, and total calculation
- Build checkout page with Cash on Delivery and UPI (offline QR code) payment options
- Create admin panel for adding and editing products with restricted access
- Apply clean, modern design with white background and green buttons throughout

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse products by category, add items to cart, checkout with cash or UPI payment, and admins can manage the product catalog through a restricted admin panel.
